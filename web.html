            ​My​ name is El Adams, I was student at Ronald Reagan High School. I am infatuated with creating different forms of art with varied mediums that I explore. For years now, I have been enjoying trying new forms of art, be it 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional. I have a desire to know many different techniques ​and apply them in unexpected ways in my work. I take an imaginative approach to my art; typically using multiple mediums and a variety of movements to create my work. My creative and strange art style is a reflection of my often outgoing personality. I aspire to produce art that makes people a little uncomfortable and forces them to create their own narrative of the piece and how it relates to the world. 

I am currently a student at UW Madison. I continue my art practice and I am working on developing a stronger sense of self in my art. I have grown from my art experiences at Reagan
